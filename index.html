                    <p>I can't remember anything
                        Can't tell if this is true or dream
                        Deep down inside I feel to scream
                        This terrible silence stops me
                        Now that the war is through with me
                        I'm waking up, I cannot see
                        That there's not much left of me
                        Nothing is real but pain now
                        Hold my breath as I wish for death
                        Oh please God, wake me
                        Back in the womb, it's much too real
                        In pumps life that I must feel
                        But can't look forward to reveal
                        Look to the time when I'll live
                        Fed through the tube that sticks in me
                        Just like a wartime novelty
                        Tied to machines that make me be
                        Cut this life off from me
                        Hold my breath as I wish for death
                        Oh please God, wake me
